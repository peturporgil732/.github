As a passionate and seasoned developer, I specialize in creating scalable web applications and services. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, I often leverage frameworks such as React and Node.js to build dynamic and responsive applications. Additionally, I am proficient in Python and have a keen interest in data science and machine learning, which allows me to blend creativity with technical skill.

Over the past several years, I have worked on numerous projects that encompass a diverse range of technologies, including RESTful APIs, GraphQL, SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. My approach to development is focused on writing clean, maintainable code and adhering to best practices in software design.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy participating in code reviews and pair programming sessions. I'm a strong advocate of agile methodologies, and I believe that iterative development leads to better product outcomes. My current interests include exploring the capabilities of TypeScript and diving deeper into DevOps practices.

Here are some of my pinned repositories that showcase my work:
- [Project A](https://github.com/peturporgil732/project-a): A full-stack web application built with React and Node.js, featuring user authentication and a robust backend.
- [Project B](https://github.com/peturporgil732/project-b): A data visualization dashboard developed in Python, utilizing Flask and Plotly, aimed at providing insights from large datasets.
- [Project C](https://github.com/peturporgil732/project-c): A microservices architecture project deployed on AWS, demonstrating my skills in cloud computing and serverless technologies.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies, so feel free to browse my repositories and connect with me on GitHub. Let's build something amazing together!
